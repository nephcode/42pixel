# 42 PIXEL desktop _
The pixel configuration for pisciners, retryers and students. setup for pixel 8 and next gen. 

## PISCINERS

**What do you find here ?**   
A beautiful setup for your 42 session. Piscine is a speedrun, you have no time to lost. Here, just pickup the files, install the app & code. you customize your version after. This version is a good launchpad.

**What we do not give here ?**   
No exercice, no anwsers, like the 42 philosophy, ask to your piscine's mates. 

## RETRYERS
I met lot of 42 retryers, I was surprise that they did have a perfect setup or a good knowledge about 42 dev experience and IDE. I think people people focus on tryhard experience and not research chill vibe experience, completion, creamy syntax colors ++
And, it's OK ;-)
